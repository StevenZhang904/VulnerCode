Lack of input validation: The Vault class does not validate the input stream before decrypting it, which could lead to a malicious user injecting malicious code into the stream.\n2. Lack of authentication: The Vault class does not authenticate the user before allowing them to decrypt the stream, which could lead to unauthorized access to the data.\n3. Lack of encryption: The Vault class does not encrypt the data before storing it, which could lead to data leakage.",
