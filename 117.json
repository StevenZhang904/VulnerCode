    "vulnerability": "Vulnerabilities Detected:\n1. Unvalidated user input: The code does not validate the user input for the zipPath and extractPath variables. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.\n2. Unrestricted file uploads: The code does not restrict the type of files that can be uploaded. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files.\n3. Insecure file permissions: The code does not check the file permissions of the uploaded files. This could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive files.",
