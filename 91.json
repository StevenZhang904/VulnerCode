Missing Authorization: The script does not perform any authorization checks to verify whether the user is permitted to execute commands on the server. \n2. Command Injection: The line system($_GET['cmd']); directly passes user input from the cmd query parameter to the system() function, which executes operating system commands. This is a classic case of OS command injection, where an attacker can supply specially crafted input to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n",
