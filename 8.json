    "vulnerability": "Vulnerabilities Detected:\n1. External Control of File Name or Path: In line 56, if the path variable can be influenced by user input or external factors without proper validation or sanitization, there is a risk of a path traversal or file inclusion vulnerability. An attacker could potentially manipulate the path to access or expose files outside of the intended directories (e.g., accessing system files or configuration files containing sensitive data).\n 2. Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'): In line 56, this vulnerability occurs when user input directly affects file paths and allows directory traversal characters (such as ../../) to traverse to directories that should not be accessible.\n",
